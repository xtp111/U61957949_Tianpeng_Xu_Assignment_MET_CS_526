# Assignment 1

## Problem 1
A tail pointer allows constant-time (O(1)) insertion at the end of the list, improving efficiency, especially for queues or when frequent insertions at the end are needed.

## Problem 2
- Code is in Node and Main
- Code is in Main
- The doIt function will print the elements of the linked list in reverse order. It first recursively traverses to the end of the list because only when node = 3 satisfy the return condition, and then during the return phase of recursion, it prints the current node’s value. For example, for a list 1 → 2 → 3, the output will be:3,2,1

## Problem 3
- Code is in QuestionThree and use it to output in Main.

## Problem 4
- Code is in QuestionFour.
